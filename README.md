# Simulating-Finnish-register-data-of-siblings

Task: Access to Finnish register data can be applyied by interested parties, but it is a time consuming process, requires specific knowledge about Finnish register data, and involves costs. This makes it difficult teach students in the use of register data and makes collaboration with international researcher difficult.  Producing sythetic datasets based on National register data can have ethical risks, simulating a dataset instead is the more applicable solution as it does not reseble existing individuals. Simulated datasets have the same variable scoring, means and SD, as well as similar correlation structure (= requires only metadata), while in sythetic datasets obtained associations might be to close the real register data shielded by the highest data and privacy protection standards. 

Solution: An R script was thus written to simulate a sibling dataset based o Finnish register data in which only one sibling has been genotyped but full phenotypical information on both siblings and their parents is available. The script can be altered to meet your needs in teaching and international collaboration.
The simulated example data is taylored for the phenotype differences model of Sam Trejo and Klint Kanopka https://github.com/sam-trejo/phenotype_differences
The the phenotype differences model can be used to identify causal relationships between polygenic scores and social / health outcomes free of environmental confounding from population stratification and dynastic genetic effects by using a single individuals genotype and phenotypic informations of a non-genotyped sibling.
